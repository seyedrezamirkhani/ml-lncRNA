# Search and Visualize

This is a personal project to help with my research in the application of Machine Learning to problems related to long chain RNA (lncRNA) molecules.

The following issues are addressed:

- Searching for academic papers and associated author data using [scholarly](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scholarly.html).

- Finding organizations associated with the papers by using Named Entity Recognition using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

- Lookup the address and geolocation of the organizations that have been identified using Nominatim via [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

- Plotting the organizations involved with the research papers on a map using [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).

- Looking for similarity between papers by inspecting the abstract section of papers using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

- Visualizing this similarity using:

  - Heatmap
  - t-SNE projection
  - [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py)
  - [PyVis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Installation

This project was developed on a X86 machine running Ubuntu 24 with conda 24.7.1. with an NVIDIA graphics card.

The python environment has been saved into different formats. See what works for you.

| Format | Command |
---------|--------
| Conda | `conda env create -f environment.yml` |
| Conda without build info | `conda env create -f environment_no-builds.yml` |
| Conda without environment name; replace new_env with your preferred name | `conda create --name new_env --file spec-file.txt` |
| pip | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

## Code layout

All code is in jupyter notebooks that are stored in src/notebooks/ folder. The files are numbered in the order in which they should be executed.

## Data storage

Html files that are generated by the notebooks are stored in the same folder as the notebooks.

Files in the pickle and parquet format are stored in the data folder at the root of the project folder.
