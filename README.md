# Search and Visualize

This is a personal project to help with my research in the application of Machine Learning to problems related to long chain RNA (lncRNA) molecules.

The following issues are addressed:

- Searching for academic papers and associated author data using [scholarly](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scholarly.html).

- Finding organizations associated with the papers by using Named Entity Recognition using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

- Lookup the address and geolocation of the organizations that have been identified using Nominatim via [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

- Plotting the organizations involved with the research papers on a map using [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).

- Looking for similarity between papers by inspecting the abstract section of papers using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

- Visualizing this similarity using:

  - Heatmap
  - t-SNE projection
  - [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py)
  - [PyVis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
