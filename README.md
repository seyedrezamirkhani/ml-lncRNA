# Search and Visualize

This is a personal project to help with my research in the application of Machine Learning to problems related to long change RNA (lncRNA) molecules.

The following issues are addressed:

- Searching for academic papers

- Finding organizations associated with the papers by using Named Entity Recognition

- Visualizing the organizations involved with the research papers on a map

- Looking for similarity between papers by inspecting the abstract section

- Visualizing this similarity
