We compute<br>the matrix of outputs as:<br>Attention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT<br>pdk)V (1)<br>The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-<br>plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor<br>of1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with<br>a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is<br>much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized<br>matrix multiplication code.<br>While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms<br>dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of<br>dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has<br>extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.<br>3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention<br>Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,<br>we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned<br>linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of<br>queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional<br>output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as<br>depicted in Figure 2.<br>Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation<br>subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.<br>4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random<br>variables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q\u0001k=Pdk<br>i=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.<br>4MultiHead( Q;K;V ) = Concat(head 1;:::;head h)WO<br>where head i= Attention( QWQ<br>i;KWK<br>i;VWV<br>i)<br>Where the projections are parameter matrices WQ<br>i2Rdmodel\u0002dk,WK<br>i2Rdmodel\u0002dk,WV<br>i2Rdmodel\u0002dv<br>andWO2Rhdv\u0002dmodel.<br>In this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use<br>dk=dv=dmodel=h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost<br>is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.<br>3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model<br>The \n",

       " uses multi-head attention in three different ways:<br>\u000fIn &quot;encoder-decoder attention&quot; layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,<br>and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every<br>position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the<br>typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as<br>[31, 2, 8].<br>\u000fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values<br>and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the<br>encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the<br>encoder.<br>\u000fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to<br>all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward<br>information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this<br>inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u00001) all values in the input<br>of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.<br>3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks<br>In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully<br>connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This<br>consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.<br>FFN(x) = max(0;xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)<br>While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters<br>from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.<br>The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality<br>dff= 2048 .<br>3.4 Embeddings and Softmax<br>Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input<br>tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-<br>mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In<br>our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax<br>linear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights bypdmodel.<br>3.5 Positional Encoding<br>Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the<br>order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the<br>tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add &quot;positional encodings&quot; to the input embeddings at the<br>5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations<br>for different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel<br>size of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.<br>Layer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length<br>Operations<br>Self-Attention O(n2\u0001d) O(1) O(1)<br>Recurrent O(n\u0001d2) O(n) O(n)<br>Convolutional O(k\u0001n\u0001d2)O(1) O(logk(n))<br>Self-Attention (restricted) O(r\u0001n\u0001d)O(1) O(n=r)<br>bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel<br>as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,<br>learned and ﬁxed [8].<br>In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:<br>PE(pos;2i)=sin(pos=100002i=d model)<br>PE(pos;2i+1)=cos(pos=100002i=d model)<br>whereposis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding<br>corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u0019to10000\u00012\u0019. We<br>chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by<br>relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of<br>PEpos.<br>We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two<br>versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version<br>because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered<br>during training.<br>4 Why Self-Attention<br>In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-<br>tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations<br>(x1;:::;x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1;:::;z n), withxi;zi2Rd, such as a hidden<br>layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we<br>consider three desiderata.<br>One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can<br>be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.<br>The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range<br>dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the<br>ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to<br>traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input<br>and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare<br>the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the<br>different layer types.<br>As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially<br>executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of<br>computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence<br>lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with<br>sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece<br>[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving<br>very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin<br>6the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum<br>path length to O(n=r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.<br>A single convolutional layer with kernel width k&lt;n does not connect all pairs of input and output<br>positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,<br>orO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths<br>between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than<br>recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity<br>considerably, to O(k\u0001n\u0001d+n\u0001d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable<br>convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,<br>the approach we take in our model.<br>As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions<br>from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention<br>heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic<br>and semantic structure of the sentences.<br>5 Training<br>This section describes the training regime for our models.<br>5.1 Training Data and Batching<br>We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million<br>sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-<br>target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT<br>2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece<br>vocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training<br>batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000<br>target tokens.<br>5.2 Hardware and Schedule<br>We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using<br>the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We<br>trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the<br>bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps<br>(3.5 days).<br>5.3 Optimizer<br>We used the Adam optimizer [ 17] with\f",

Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections<br>around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention<br>sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This<br>masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the<br>predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.<br>3.2 Attention<br>An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,<br>where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum<br>of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the<br>query with the corresponding key.<br>3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention<br>We call our particular attention &quot;Scaled Dot-Product Attention&quot; (Figure 2).

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute<br>the matrix of outputs as:<br>Attention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT<br>pdk)V (1)<br>The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-<br>plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor<br>of1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with<br>a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is<br>much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized<br>matrix multiplication code.<br>While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms<br>dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of<br>dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has<br>extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.<br>3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention<br>Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,<br>we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned<br>linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

       " uses multi-head attention in three different ways:<br>\u000fIn &quot;encoder-decoder attention&quot; layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,<br>and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every<br>position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the<br>typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as<br>[31, 2, 8].<br>\u000fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values<br>and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the<br>encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the<br>encoder.<br>\u000fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to<br>all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward<br>information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this<br>inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u00001) all values in the input<br>of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.<br>3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks<br>In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully<br>connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

We also use the usual learned linear transfor-<br>mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In<br>our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax<br>linear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights bypdmodel.<br>3.5 Positional Encoding<br>Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the<br>order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the<br>tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add &quot;positional encodings&quot; to the input embeddings at the<br>5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations<br>for different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel<br>size of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.<br>Layer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length<br>Operations<br>Self-Attention O(n2\u0001d) O(1) O(1)<br>Recurrent O(n\u0001d2) O(n) O(n)<br>Convolutional O(k\u0001n\u0001d2)O(1) O(logk(n))<br>Self-Attention (restricted) O(r\u0001n\u0001d)O(1) O(n=r)<br>bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.

There are many choices of positional encodings,<br>learned and ﬁxed [8].<br>In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:<br>PE(pos;2i)=sin(pos=100002i=d model)<br>PE(pos;2i+1)=cos(pos=100002i=d model)<br>whereposis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding<br>corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u0019to10000\u00012\u0019. We<br>chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by<br>relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of<br>PEpos.<br>We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two<br>versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version<br>because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered<br>during training.<br>4 Why Self-Attention<br>In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-<br>tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations<br>(x1;:::;x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1;:::;z n), withxi;zi2Rd, such as a hidden<br>layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we<br>consider three desiderata.<br>One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can<br>be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.<br>The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range<br>dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the<br>ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to<br>traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input<br>and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare<br>the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the<br>different layer types.<br>As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially<br>executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of<br>computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence<br>lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with<br>sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece<br>[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving<br>very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin<br>6the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum<br>path length to O(n=r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.<br>A single convolutional layer with kernel width k&lt;n does not connect all pairs of input and output<br>positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,<br>orO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths<br>between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than<br>recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity<br>considerably, to O(k\u0001n\u0001d+n\u0001d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable<br>convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,<br>the approach we take in our model.<br>As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions<br>from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention<br>heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic<br>and semantic structure of the sentences.<br>5 Training<br>This section describes the training regime for our models.<br>5.1 Training Data and Batching<br>We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million<br>sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-<br>target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT<br>2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece<br>vocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training<br>batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000<br>target tokens.<br>5.2 Hardware and Schedule<br>We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using<br>the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We<br>trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the<br>bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds.

We compute<br>the matrix of outputs as:<br>Attention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT<br>pdk)V (1)<br>The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-<br>plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor<br>of1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with<br>a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is<br>much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized<br>matrix multiplication code.<br>While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms<br>dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of<br>dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has<br>extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.<br>3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention<br>Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,<br>we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned<br>linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

       " uses multi-head attention in three different ways:<br>\u000fIn &quot;encoder-decoder attention&quot; layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,<br>and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every<br>position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the<br>typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as<br>[31, 2, 8].<br>\u000fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values<br>and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the<br>encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the<br>encoder.<br>\u000fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to<br>all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward<br>information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this<br>inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u00001) all values in the input<br>of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.<br>3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks<br>In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully<br>connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

We also use the usual learned linear transfor-<br>mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In<br>our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax<br>linear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights bypdmodel.<br>3.5 Positional Encoding<br>Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the<br>order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the<br>tokens in the sequence.

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding<br>corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u0019to10000\u00012\u0019. We<br>chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by<br>relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of<br>PEpos.<br>We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two<br>versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version<br>because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered<br>during training.<br>4 Why Self-Attention<br>In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-<br>tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations<br>(x1;:::;x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1;:::;z n), withxi;zi2Rd, such as a hidden<br>layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we<br>consider three desiderata.<br>One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can<br>be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.<br>The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range<br>dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the<br>ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to<br>traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input<br>and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare<br>the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the<br>different layer types.<br>As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially<br>executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of<br>computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence<br>lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with<br>sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece<br>[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving<br>very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin<br>6the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum<br>path length to O(n=r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.<br>A single convolutional layer with kernel width k&lt;n does not connect all pairs of input and output<br>positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,<br>orO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths<br>between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than<br>recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity<br>considerably, to O(k\u0001n\u0001d+n\u0001d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable<br>convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,<br>the approach we take in our model.<br>As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions<br>from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention<br>heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic<br>and semantic structure of the sentences.<br>5 Training<br>This section describes the training regime for our models.<br>5.1 Training Data and Batching<br>We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million<br>sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-<br>target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT<br>2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece<br>vocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training<br>batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000<br>target tokens.<br>5.2 Hardware and Schedule<br>We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using<br>the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We<br>trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.
